# Live Member Face Recognition Deployment
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a more efficient way to verify memberships and grant access to members without unnecessary delays. <br>
This issue exists in places like Costco, sporting events, and other venues where long queues form just to validate entry credentials.<br>
The goal is to eliminate long wait times by allowing members to gain access seamlessly through facial recognition, reducing the need for manual verification

## Project Proposal  
To solve this problem, I developed a real-time face recognition system using computer vision.<br>
In [Practicum 1](https://github.com/johnmunoz777/LMFD_MSDS_Practicum) I built a YOLOv8 face recognition model.<br>
The purpose of Practicum 2 was to deploy this model so anyone can add themselves to it and  
employees can validate members in real time via a webcam on our website: [Face Detection Demo](https://facedetectiondemo.com)
